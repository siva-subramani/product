The &ldquo;Free Delivery Manager&rdquo; module is actually the perfect solution for offering your respected customers free shipping through objective rules. It is the promise of <strong>a rise in the amount of orders<\/strong> with total <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong>.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe module allows you to calculate in advance, with the help of precise rules, the necessary conditions for unlocking free delivery. The management and monitoring are done according to carriers, delivery area, price, weight, or any other criteria you term as important for your business.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe &ldquo;Free Delivery Manager&rdquo; module offers <strong>control of delivery costs<\/strong> by releasing delivery available as a function of criteria you have chosen. All the carriers have their own price list. You may, for example, indicate a minimum order amount by carrier<br \/>\r\nIn presenting to the customer, in their order summary, the amount remaining before delivery is available, so you definitely encourage them to <strong>order more<\/strong>.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nHighly detailed statistics visually present two types of reports together. The first one presents the number of orders that have benefited from free delivery, as well as the total and per-order amount that this cost you. You really <strong>control the impact<\/strong> of delivery costs.<br \/>\r\nThe second report displays the detail of costs caused by free postage and the orders where the rules for free shipping are applied. Thus, the &ldquo;Free Delivery Manager&rdquo; module increases the value of transactions as well as the number of orders!<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis module has been constantly evolving, many thanks to user feedback.

So what is the concept really all about?<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>Subscription-based e-commerce is an excellent way for brands and retailers to begin a process of getting to know their client\u00e8le and establish customer loyalty: <strong>the real strength of this economic system is simply its powerful ability to generate customer loyalty!<\/strong><\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>Another advantage is that subscription-based e-commerce enables you to benefit from <strong>recurring monthly revenue without having to rely on the acquisition of new customers<\/strong>. What's more, subscription-based e-commerce encourages consumers to indulge and to re-purchase your products if they are impressed.<\/div><div>It stands to reason that there is no-one more loyal than a customer who pays a subscription, but be careful, there are a few down sides to the subscription nowadays: customers are developing an increasing dislike to being tied in. As a result you have to grant him a great deal of freedom; he must be able to cancel his subscription whenever he sees fit!\u00a0<\/div><div>If at the beginning of the month your customer no longer wishes to receive the product or products for which he has subscribed, it should not have to be delivered nor billed for. Nevertheless, the likelihood that the customer will continue to use the service is much more important than is the case with \"traditional\" e-commerce! It is the assurance of regular monthly turnover, alongside the ability to manage your stock levels.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><strong>Our Advanced Subscription module for PrestaShop takes into account all of these precepts and saves you the precious time that would be required to implement them manually.<\/strong><\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>The reason that the paid subscription model is developing so quickly within the area of e-commerce is that retail sites appear to find in it an effective solution by which to counteract one of the main issues that chips away at their profitability: delivery fees<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>Amazon Premium, Fnac Express+, Cdiscount \u00e0 volont\u00e9... Many e-commerce retailers are now launching their own paid subscription services. In order to grasp the reason behind the phenomenon, one need only remember the fact that delivery fees remain the leading cause of abandoned shopping carts and that, on average, a subscribing customer is twice as lucrative as a non-subscribing customer.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><strong>A few figures to quantify the impact of delivery on e-business:<\/strong><\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>87% of online shoppers systematically search for a means by which to avoid having to pay shipping fees (searching for a promotional code, addition of a product to the cart...).<\/div><div>44% abandon their purchases purely and simply on account of these fees<\/div><div>66% switch to a different retail site in search of delivery conditions that are acceptable to them.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>Converting customers into subscribers enables online retailers to save time and money compared to traditional methods of recovering customers and generating customer loyalty, as it allows you automate part of the customer relationship. This saving can then be allocated to a free delivery service reserved solely for your subscribers, thus eliminating this purchasing deterrent and in turn achieving much greater conversion rates.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><strong>Objective: to generate long-term customer loyalty<\/strong><\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>In addition to the appeal of novelty, subscription-based e-commerce represents a formidable double-edged sword for brands that are reliant on distribution networks and that are targeting growth. In actual fact, first and foremost the subscription principle allows retailers to generate recurrent turnover and a stable operating account.<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>Thus, while subscription-based e-commerce may have cut its teeth with samples and travel-sized products, various other products now also appear to lend themselves to the model: in ready-to-wear clothing, cosmetics, culture and leisure, but also products intended for regular consumption such as mineral water or hygiene products (baby nappies for instance).<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div>\u00a0<\/div><div><strong>Optimization of supply and of your logistics<\/strong><\/div><div>The subscription enables you to achieve an improved rate of re-purchase, thus allowing you to purchase from your suppliers more efficiently.
