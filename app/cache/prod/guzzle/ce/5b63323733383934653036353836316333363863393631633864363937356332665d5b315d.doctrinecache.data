As soon as users give their consent, the warning banner disappears and all the modules using cookies will get enabled and will work as usual. But if users refuse to give their consent, the disabled modules will remain disabled. We recommend you to use this mode, this one allows you to fully comply with the law.<\/li>\t<li>Acceptance through the navigation: If users continue browsing the website, they will accept the use of cookies. The warning banner is displayed on the first page on which users arrive with a message like \u00ab\u00a0By<em> continuing browsing the website, you accept the use of cookies\u00a0\u00bb. <\/em>As soon as users decide to go to another page, the banner automatically disappears and the disabled modules will get enabled.<\/li><\/ul>Note: the consent remains valid during the period of time set in the module interface (we recommend you not to go over 13 months)<br \/><br \/><u><strong>Customizing the banner content and design<\/strong><\/u><br \/><br \/>As recommended by the European authority, the module allows you to customize the warning message inside the banner (to inform users about the cookies users and their purpose) and add a \"More information\" button into the banner that take users to a CMS page of your store (to explain in details the use of cookies on your store).<br \/><br \/>The warning banner is responsive and will always be displayed full-width. The module comes with a Wysiwyg editor that allows you to fully customize the content of the banner (font, color, effects, html code, links...). You can also choose from the configuration page the background color of the banner, its percentage of opacity (transparency) and its position (top or bottom of the page). Moreover, the module is multilingual and automatically detects all the languages of your store, which allows you to set a different warning message per language.<br \/><br \/>Note: the module is designed to not display a warning message when search engines robots crawl you store in order not to affect your SEO.<br \/><br \/><u><strong>Disabling the modules that use cookies<\/strong><\/u><br \/><br \/>This is the only module that allows you to choose the modules\/cookies that you want to disable until users give their consent.
